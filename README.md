# DR-RGB-TOOL

A tool that dynamically interfaces with an OpenRGB server and syncs your RGB system to the current subclass of your most recently played Guardian in Destiny 2. 

Uses the Bungie API as well as the OpenRGB library. Requires OpenRGB to be installed and running. I reccomend setting up OpenRGB to run at PC boot and to have it minimized to the system tray.
