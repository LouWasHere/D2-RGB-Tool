# D2-RGB-TOOL

A tool that dynamically interfaces with an OpenRGB server and syncs your RGB system to the current subclass of your most recently played Guardian in Destiny 2. 

It's not that quick. Blame the Bungie APIs for that one. But if it's more of a vibe that you're after then this is the thing for you.

Uses the Bungie API as well as the OpenRGB library. Requires OpenRGB to be installed and running. I reccomend setting up OpenRGB to run at PC boot and to have it minimized to the system tray.

If you like, you can install my cert.pem into your browser so that the app won't cause it to panic and warn you when it tries to redirect back to localhost after authenticating with Bungie.

It's quite good. Better than Gigabyte's OEM software, anyway.
